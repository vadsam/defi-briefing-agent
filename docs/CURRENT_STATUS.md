# Hi, continue Defi Briefing Agent Project

# Current Status

**Week**: 2 (MCP Foundations)  
**Day**: 2 Completed ✅  
**Last Completed**: Build SQLite MCP Server From Scratch  
**Next Task**: Test SQLite MCP Integration with Claude Desktop (Week 2, Day 3)  
**Issues**: None  
**Ready**: Yes

## Architecture Decisions Made
- ✅ **MCP Integration Plan**: Following MCP learning path (not original master plan)
- ✅ **Desktop Claude**: All interactions in Desktop Claude (files + search + guidance)
- ✅ **Hybrid MCP Strategy**: Development (Desktop MCP) + Production (JSON/Docker)
- ✅ **Learning Focus**: Master complete MCP ecosystem from dev to production
- ✅ **Database Learning**: Build custom SQLite MCP → Custom Crypto MCP → LangGraph multi-agent
- ✅ **Claude Code**: Will be used for git operations and terminal commands
- ✅ **GitHub Integration**: Native Claude Desktop project import only (no MCP git operations)
- ✅ **MCP Server Architecture**: FastMCP for decorators, tools/resources pattern mastered

## Today's Achievements (Week 2, Day 2)
✅ Built complete SQLite MCP server from scratch using FastMCP  
✅ Mastered MCP debugging (imports, API discovery, systematic fixing)  
✅ Implemented async SQLite operations with proper error handling  
✅ Created 6 functional tools and 2 resources for project tracking  
✅ Validated server works locally before Claude Desktop integration  

## Next Session Goals (Week 2, Day 3)
- Configure SQLite MCP server in Claude Desktop
- Test live MCP integration during conversation
- Use MCP server for actual project tracking
- Document MCP integration patterns for crypto server
